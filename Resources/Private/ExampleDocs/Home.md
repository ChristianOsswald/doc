# Project documentation

This module documents all **content elements**, **plugins** and any other important information you need to use this website.

> By using **Markdown** it is easy to create and maintain the documentation using the same IDE and code base (e.g. GIT)
> whilst you're developing the features.
>
> Documentation is as important for the editors who use the extension as it is for the extension creator.
